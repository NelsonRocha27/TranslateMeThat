# TranslateMeThat

## Introduction
What's one of the most used objects daily?  
Smartphones. Nowadays mobile phones have become an essential part of our lives.  
These devices can easily change the displayed language if we want to. So why not take advantage of that learn other language and increase some vocabulary.  

That's where TranslateMeThat comes handy, at anytime, at any displayed text on your screen you can immediatly translate it and learn something.  
  
This is my first Android application and first time using Java.  

## Usage example

This application uses mlkit from Google for text recognition, language identifaction and translation.  
This is some free Google API hence not always translations are perfect and sometimes wierd fonts are hard to translate, still overall, it works quite well!  
  
For users, the application is quite simple, it just consists of a movable semi-transparent floating button, identified as a german flag in examples #1, #2 and #3. Although this is a german flag it can be changed without an big effort to other language, it was just the language model loaded at the time and the language I want to learn the most right now. Then at any given time, whenever we want to translate anything on the screen we can simply click on that flag button and translation will start. After that a close button will appear in the place of the flag and by clicking on it the translation will be erased from the screen and back to the language flag so that user can continue normal navigation and perhaps translate a few more things after that.
