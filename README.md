# TranslateMeThat

## Introduction
What's one of the most used objects daily?  
Smartphones. Nowadays mobile phones have become an essential part of our lives.  
These devices can easily change the displayed language if we want to. So why not take advantage of that learn other language and increase some vocabulary.  

That's where TranslateMeThat comes handy, at anytime, at any displayed text on your screen you can immediatly translate it and learn something.  
  
This is my first Android application and first time using Java.  

## Usage example

This application uses mlkit from Google for text recognition, language identifaction and translation.  
This is some free Google API hence not always translations are perfect and sometimes wierd fonts are hard to translate, still overall, it works quite well!
